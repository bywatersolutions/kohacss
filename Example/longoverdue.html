/* Suitable for #10 Window Envelope
 * with 1.125" x 4.5" window, 0.875 from left margin.
 * Adjustments may be needed to top and left, based on
 * printer margins.
 *
 * See http://www.windowenvelopes.com/envelope_sizes_a/257.htm
 *
 * It is good practice to do a 'tap test' when choosing envelope
 * window dimensions -- fold and stuff the envelope, then tap
 * the envelope against a hard surface to make sure that the
 * address block still shows when the mailer shifts inside the
 * envelope; there should be 1/4" clearance at the bottom.
